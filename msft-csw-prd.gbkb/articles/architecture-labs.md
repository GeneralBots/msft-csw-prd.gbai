Please note that:

1. We will provide a sample dataset. This dataset contains documents with multiple languages and formats including HTML, doc, pdf, ppt, png and jpg. They were selected for a better learning experience, showcasing most of the technology capabilities.
2. You can upload the data to blob storage using [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal) or [Azure Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-storage-explorer), among other options.
3. We will start with a few simple skills and add more complex Cognitive Skills in labs 2 and 3.
4. We will use Azure Search query capabilities to analyze the results.
