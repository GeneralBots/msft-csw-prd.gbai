### Cognitive Search

Cognitive Search adds intelligence to your indexing workloads. Workloads often have unstructured text or non-text content (such as images or scanned document files) - wouldn't it be better if you could still search on them? Cognitive Search is able to extract text-based content, and then cognitive skills can be used to apply entity recognition, language detection, sentiment analysis, OCR (recognize handwriting), and more to your content. You can also use cognitive skills to analyze images to identify content, famous people or landmarks, and descriptions - and search on that!  

Let's think about a specific example, the assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald. Over the last 40-50 years, there has been significant controversy around the JFK files. Recently, over 50,000 documents were released related to the case. Now, let's say we want to analyze these documents and get to the bottom of what really happened that day in November 1963. It's an unreasonable request (or very time-consuming, depending on your opinion) for us to read all of those documents. With Azure Search, we can search text in some of the documents. But what else might we want to do?  

Maybe we want to be able to extract various entities, perhaps, looking into the occurrences of Oswald in the documents. We don't want to see only the .doc results - we want the images of him, the hand-written notes about him, PDFs and more. Basically, we want to be able to pick out, intelligently, **all** the occurrences of Oswald.  

In the case, investigators used many codenames, or "cryptonyms", which are defined [here](https://www.maryferrell.org/php/cryptdb.php#_GP). We can see that the cryptonym for Oswald was actually "GPFLOOR." So if you really want to get **all** occurrences of Oswald, we also need to build into the system that Oswald = GPFLOOR (also that GPIDEAL = JFK, GPLOGIC = LBJ, etc.).

It turns out, that in the documents, you can find that it cost the CIA millions of dollars and a very long time (months) to architect a system (and pay many people to manually tag all the documents) that they could use to try to accomplish the goals above. However, with [Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-intro), two people were able to accomplish the same goals in **days**.  

How did they do it? First, they stored all the data in Azure blob storage and they extracted the content using Cognitive Search. Next, they were able to simply use [predefined Cognitive Skills](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-predefined-skills) ([OCR and handwriting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-ocr), [Computer Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-image-analysis), and [Entity extraction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-named-entity-recognition)) to do a lot of analyses that would have otherwise been very complicated and time-consuming to architect and develop. They were also able to create [custom skills](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface) quickly using [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-create-custom-skill-example) (to address cryptonyms and redactions with Azure ML).  Finally, they created an Azure Search Index on top of it all with a nice web interface so we can explore (you can check it out at jfk-demo.azurewebsites.net/#/).  

As you can probably tell by now, Cognitive Search made the process more efficient and easier to implement.
