### Brief Discussion
Can you think of other scenarios where this technology might be useful? We've included a few ideas below:  

- Education  
    - For a student, in a class you may have resources in many different forms: 
        - PowerPoint slides (as .pptx or .pdf)
        - Handwritten notes (scanned on your phone to .pdf, .jpg, or .png)
        - Old tests with answers (.pdf, .jpg, .png, .html)
        - Pictures of whiteboard scribbles from the professor during lectures
        - Etc. 
    - Wouldn't it be nice if you could search on a topic across all these different file formats?  
- Manufacturing
    - Even with technology advancements, lots of things are still handwritten in these environments
        - Time sheets
        - Notes during shifts: data about throughput, efficiency, etc.
        - SOPs (standard operating procedures)
    - In addition, there are PDFs (some SOPs), Excel files, Access databases, etc.
    - This could be a good opportunity to coordinate and automate a lot of the analyses
- Justice system
    - Like the JFK files examples, many cases have lots of data in varying forms, similar value could be provided
- Twitter and big events (e.g. festivals like Coachella or NFL games)
    - Could use the service to ingest tweets for big events and perform sentiment analysis and key phrases extraction.
- Business documents, fom all enterprises in all industries
    - Every company has unstructured data stored on file servers, cloud devices and local computers: images, pdfs, ppts, xls, docs, html and so on.
    - Most of this huge data volume is siloed and has no metadata, making search a limited experience.
    - Cognitive Search can help any company to enrich the metadata of its own data, helping to increase productivity and even security/compliance.
